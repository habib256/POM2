Floppy Emu (BMOW) — SD card folder
==================================

This folder is the virtual "SD card" for POM2's Floppy Emu device
(Devices -> Floppy Emu), a faithful model of the Big Mess o' Wires
Floppy Emu disk emulator. Drop your disk images here and pick them
from the Floppy Emu's on-screen OLED browser.

It is kept SEPARATE from the Disk Library folders (disks/, disks35/,
hdv/) on purpose — the Floppy Emu has its own card, just like the real
device. You can subfolder freely (e.g. floppyemu/GAMES/, floppyemu/OS/);
the OLED file browser walks into subdirectories.

Which images show up depends on the selected emulation mode:

  Apple II 5.25 Floppy   .dsk .do .po .nib .woz .2mg   (140K)
  Apple II 3.5 Floppy    .dsk .do .po .2mg             (800K)
  Unidisk 3.5            .dsk .do .po .2mg             (800K)
  Smartport Hard Disk    .po .hdv .2mg                 (up to 32 MB)

Optional: a "favdisks.txt" file in this folder turns on the Favorites
menu. List one image path per line (relative to this folder, or
absolute). An optional first line "automount N" sets startup behaviour
(0 = never, 1 = first favorite, 2 = most recently used) — matching the
real Floppy Emu's favdisks.txt format.

The folder location can be changed via the floppyemu_sd_root setting in
state.cfg.
