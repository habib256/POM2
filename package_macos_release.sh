# package_macos_release.sh — build POM2 and produce dist/POM2-macOS-v<ver>.dmg
# containing a Universal 2 (arm64 + x86_64) .app.
#
# Layout inside the bundle:
#   POM2.app/Contents/MacOS/POM2          the universal binary
#   POM2.app/Contents/Resources/POM2.icns the icon
#   POM2.app/Contents/Resources/{fonts,pic,roms}
#   POM2.app/Contents/Info.plist          from packaging/macos/Info.plist.in
#
# Asset resolution needs no special case: pom2::resourceSearchDirs() probes
# <exe>/.. , which from Contents/MacOS resolves to Contents/ — so the standard
# Resources/ location is found by adding one search root. See the note below.
#
# The full roms/ tree (system + peripheral dumps + floppy_samples) is bundled
# under Contents/Resources/roms/ so the .app boots without a separate ROM drop.
#
# Env:
#   POM2_VERSION        version for the artifact name (default: from CMakeLists)
#   POM2_MACOS_ARCHS    CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES (default "arm64;x86_64")
#   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH   where to find the universal static GLFW
