=== Setup complete. ===

Build:
  cd build && make -j

Run from the repo root (so roms/ probes resolve):
  ./build/POM2

ROM placement:
  Drop an Apple II / II+ ROM image at roms/apple2.rom (12 KB = \$D000-\$FFFF
  or 16 KB = \$C000-\$FFFF). Optional 2 KB character ROM at roms/apple2_char.rom
  (current build falls back to a built-in 5x7 ASCII font when missing).
