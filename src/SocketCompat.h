//
// SocketCompat.h — the ONE place that answers "POSIX sockets or Winsock?".
//
// POM2's four networking translation units (AiControlServer's HTTP control
// API, SuperSerialCard's telnet bridge, W5100Device's Uthernet II host TCP/IP,
// SpTcpTransport's FujiNet SP-over-SLIP pipe)
// were written against BSD sockets. Winsock2 is the same protocol stack behind
// a gratuitously different API, and the differences are *silent* ones — code
// that compiles clean against Winsock can still be wrong. The seven traps, all
// of which this header exists to remove (the fifth is not Winsock's fault but
// bit this port anyway — see closeHostSocket):
//
//   1. `SOCKET` IS UNSIGNED (`UINT_PTR`), and the failure value is
//      `INVALID_SOCKET` = `(SOCKET)~0`, not -1. So `if (fd >= 0)` is
//      ALWAYS TRUE on Windows and `fd = -1` marks a socket as *valid*
//      with a huge handle. Every "is this open?" test in the POSIX idiom
//      inverts its meaning without a single warning. Use `kInvalidSocket`
//      and `isValidSocket()`; never compare a socket to 0 or -1.
//   2. Errors do not go through `errno`. `WSAGetLastError()` carries them,
//      the codes are different (`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`, not `EWOULDBLOCK`), and
//      `strerror` cannot render them. Use `lastSocketError()` +
//      `socketErrorText()`.
//   3. `close()` does not close a socket (it closes a CRT file descriptor —
//      a different namespace); `closesocket()` does. `fcntl(O_NONBLOCK)`
//      does not exist; `ioctlsocket(FIONBIO)` is the equivalent.
//   4. The stack must be started per process with `WSAStartup` before the
//      first call, or every socket call fails with WSANOTINITIALISED.
//      `ensureSocketStack()` does it once, thread-safely.
//   5. (POM2's own, not Winsock's — see closeHostSocket.)
//   6. `SO_REUSEADDR` MEANS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY. On POSIX it only
//      relaxes TIME_WAIT and a second LIVE bind to the same address still
//      fails; on Winsock it lets any process bind an address another
//      socket is already listening on, and the later binder collects the
//      new connections. Setting it on Windows the way POSIX code does
//      turns a loopback listener into something a local process can
//      hijack. Use `setListenerBindPolicy()`, never the raw option.
//   7. DATAGRAM ERRORS DESCRIBE THE PACKET, NOT THE SOCKET. Winsock's
//      recvfrom fails an oversized datagram with WSAEMSGSIZE instead of
//      truncating it, and surfaces an ICMP port-unreachable from an
//      earlier sendto as WSAECONNRESET on an UNCONNECTED UDP socket —
//      neither of which POSIX reports at all. Code that closes the socket
//      on "any error but EWOULDBLOCK" therefore destroys a working UDP
//      socket on Windows the first time a peer is unreachable. Classify
//      with `errDatagramDiscard()` and turn the ICMP report off with
//      `disableUdpConnReset()`.
//
// Not compiled under Emscripten: the browser has no usable BSD-socket API at
// all, so those paths stay compiled out via POM2_HAS_SOCKETS (Pom2Build.h).

///
/// One intent, two options, because `SO_REUSEADDR` is not the same feature
/// on the two families (trap 6):
///
///   POSIX   SO_REUSEADDR relaxes exactly one rule — a lingering TIME_WAIT
///           from the previous run no longer blocks the bind. A second
///           LIVE socket on the same address still gets EADDRINUSE, which
///           is the half we want to keep.
///   Winsock SO_REUSEADDR means "let anyone bind this address even while
///           somebody is listening on it", and the later binder wins the
///           new connections (MS: "Using SO_REUSEADDR"). On a listener the
///           agent talks to, that is a hijack: another local process binds
///           127.0.0.1:6503, serves the agent's requests, and collects the
///           control token on the way past. SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE is the
///           documented spelling of the POSIX intent — it also lets this
///           process re-bind its own port once the old socket is closed,
///           so the restart case is covered too.
