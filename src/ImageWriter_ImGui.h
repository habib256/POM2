// ImageWriter_ImGui — the paper tray: shows what the emulated Apple
// ImageWriter II has printed. Front-panel buttons (FORM FEED / RESET),
// the completed-sheet stack, a zoomable page view and PNG export.
//
// Unlike the other *_ImGui panels this one is not purely data-in /
// actions-out: it owns a GL texture (the page raster is a megapixel image,
// so it is uploaded once per change rather than rebuilt by the caller) and
// it drives the `ImageWriter` directly. That is safe because an
// `ImageWriter` is host-side only — no emulator state, no `stateMutex`,
// UI thread throughout. MainWindow still owns the printer itself and is
// the one that feeds it bytes drained from the interface card's spool.
