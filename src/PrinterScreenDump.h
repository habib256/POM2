// PrinterScreenDump — "print what is on screen", as a dot-matrix bit-image
// stream.
//
// Ported from the design in mikedaley/web-a2e's `src/js/printer/screen-dump.js`
// (MIT, (c) 2025 Mike Daley), whose central insight is worth restating because
// it is what makes this honest rather than a screenshot pasted onto paper:
//
//   THE DUMP SYNTHESISES THE WIRE FORMAT PERIOD SOFTWARE WOULD HAVE SENT, AND
//   PUSHES IT THROUGH THE PRINTER'S REAL PARSER.
//
// Nothing here paints a page pixel. It emits the same `ESC G` byte stream a
// Grappler ROM or Print Shop drives the head with, hands it to
// `ImageWriter::queueBytes`, and lets the existing bit-image path do the rest.
// So the dump exercises the graphics parser, obeys the ribbon and the pacing,
// lands in the paper tray and the PDF export, and cannot drift away from what
// a real driver produces.
//
// ── The scan ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The head prints a horizontal BAND at a time: 8 vertical dots packed into one
// column byte, one byte per horizontal position, then a line feed to the next
// band. The framebuffer walk is identical for every printer in the family;
// only the wire format differs, which is why the protocol constants sit in one
// place (`ScreenDumpProtocol`) rather than being sprinkled through the loop.
//
// C. Itoh / ImageWriter / Apple DMP:   `ESC G` + 4 ASCII digits, bit 0 = top
// Epson FX-80 (not implemented yet):   `ESC *` + 2 binary bytes, bit 7 = top
//
// ── Threshold and inversion ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The screen is light-on-dark and paper is dark-on-light, so a naive dump of a
// text screen would flood the page with ink. `autoInvert` picks by lit
// density: mostly-dark screens (graphics) print their lit pixels, mostly-lit
// ones invert. A caller that knows better can force it.
