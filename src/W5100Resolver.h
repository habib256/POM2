// W5100Resolver — the name-lookup surface the Uthernet II device calls.
//
// The device asks a question ("what address is this hostname?") and gets an
// answer or a "not yet". It has no business knowing that answering involves a
// thread, a bounded wait or a cache — those are runtime concerns, and the
// configure-time layer guard rejects a device that reaches for them.
//
// W5100NameResolver is the production implementation. A test substitutes its
// own and answers instantly.
