// Memory watchpoints — the tables behind the debugger's write and read
// watches. Kept out of Memory.cpp: it is a concern of its own, and Memory.cpp
// is the god-object the file-size ratchet refuses to grow.
//
// The hot-path halves live elsewhere, on purpose:
//   * memWrite's diversion is the `writable[]` byte this file clears
//     (Memory.h § Write watchpoints) — nothing is tested for on that path;
//   * memRead's gates are the three derived bytes refreshReadFastFlags()
//     recomputes (Memory.h § Read watchpoints), and the report itself is the
//     memReadSlow wrapper in Memory.cpp, which must stay in that TU so the
//     slow body can be force-inlined into it (PERFORMANCE § 8.5).
// What is here is the bookkeeping: arm, disarm, the shadowed permission.
