// Host-pointer capture ("mouse grab") policy for the Apple II Mouse Card.
//
// One concern: *deciding* what a host input event means while the pointer is
// (or isn't) captured. Actually flipping GLFW's cursor mode, hiding the OS
// cursor and feeding the card lives in MainWindow — this header only answers
// the questions, so the decisions stay pinnable by a headless test that links
// no windowing stack.
//
// Why grab at all? The Mouse Card (both variants) is a purely *relative*
// quadrature device: MainWindow converts host-pixel deltas into Apple mouse
// units and the guest firmware clamps them at its own window edges. Without a
// grab, the host pointer hits the edge of the Apple II Screen widget (or of
// the desktop) long before the guest cursor reaches the edge of its clamp
// window, and every further delta is lost — the two cursors desynchronise and
// the guest cursor can become unable to reach a menu bar or a scroll gutter.
// Capturing the pointer (GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED) removes the boundary entirely:
// GLFW reports an unbounded virtual position, so deltas keep flowing in every
// direction for as long as the user keeps moving.
//
// Capture is entered and left by exactly two deliberate gestures, the ones
// every VM viewer and PC emulator already trains into the user's fingers:
// **Ctrl+Alt+G**, or a click on the **middle button (wheel)**. Both TOGGLE.
//
// A left click deliberately does NOT capture. It used to, which is the
// classic "click the screen to give the guest your mouse" contract, but it
// makes an ordinary click silently change what every later click means — and
// the capturing click has to be swallowed to avoid firing the guest's button
// at an arbitrary spot, so the user's first click just vanishes. Left clicks
// now always mean what they look like: a click for the guest when the screen
// is hovered (or captured), an ImGui click otherwise.
//
// A useful consequence: capture can only be ENTERED by the same gesture that
// LEAVES it, so anyone who is captured already knows how to get out. That is
// what lets the on-screen caption go away — the reminder lives in the status
// bar, and discoverability no longer has to be solved before a stray click.
