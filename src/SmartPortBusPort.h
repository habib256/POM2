// SmartPortBusPort — the contract between a machine's disk-port decode and
// an intelligent SmartPort device answering on it.
//
// The 32 KB //c's own firmware talks to its external 3.5" drive as a
// UniDisk: a byte protocol over the IWM's registers at $C0E0-$C0EF. The
// memory map (MACHINE layer) decodes those addresses; what answers them is
// a device (DEVICES layer). This header is the seam between the two, kept
// free of both so `MemoryProfile` can name it without knowing the IWM
// register tracker or the packet decoder behind it — `IIcExternalSmartPort`
// is the implementation, `SmartPortBusDevice` the protocol.
