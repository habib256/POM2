// PrinterSoundSink — header-only abstract interface so `ImageWriter` can
// report mechanical events without dragging the miniaudio-based
// `PrinterSoundDevice` translation unit into every headless build and test.
// Same pattern, and the same reason, as `FloppySoundSink`.
//
// ── Why there is no `emuCycles` here, unlike the floppy ───────────────────
//
// `FloppySoundSink::step` carries an emulated-cycle stamp because the GUEST
// drives the stepper directly: under POM2's ~60x disk turbo a whole phase
// sweep lands inside one audio buffer, so wall-clock gaps collapse to zero and
// the cadence classifier goes deaf.
//
// The printer is not like that. `ImageWriter` consumes its input queue on its
// OWN wall-clock pacing model (`tick(double dt)`, at the head's cps), so the
// guest can fire a job in at any speed and the head still moves at 180 cps.
// These events are therefore already in real time when they are emitted, and
// stamping them would add nothing. (The printer plan's § 9 claimed otherwise;
// it was wrong, and this is the correction.)
