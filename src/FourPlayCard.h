// FourPlayCard — the **4play** joystick card, a port of MAME's
// `src/devices/bus/a2bus/4play.cpp`.
//
// Four DIGITAL joysticks on an Apple II. That is the whole point: the
// machine's own game port is *analogue* and carries two paddles, so two
// players with sticks is the ceiling and the software has to time an RC
// discharge to read them. This card is four bytes at `$C0nX` — read one,
// get one player's directions and buttons, no timing, no calibration.
//
// It is **modern homebrew**, not period hardware: Lukazi designed it in
// 2016 (MAME's own header links the blog). So the software that uses it is
// the current Apple II homebrew scene rather than a 1980s catalogue — which
// is the honest reason to want it here, and the reason it is a small card
// rather than a big one.
//
// THE WHOLE DEVICE, from MAME `4play.cpp:95-140`: `read_c0nx` returns
// player 1-4 for offsets 0-3 and `0xFF` for everything else. There is no
// write side, no ROM, no state — MAME's `device_start()` is empty. What
// POM2 adds is the only thing it must: a place for the host's gamepads to
// deposit their state, which is why the four bytes are atomics.
//
// Threading follows `PaddleInputs`: the UI thread writes, the CPU worker
// reads, and neither takes `stateMutex` for it. Joystick position is host
// input, not emulated state — so it is deliberately absent from the
// snapshot, exactly as the game-port paddles are. A rewind must not put
// somebody's thumb back where it was.
