// CharRomDump — what an Apple II character-generator dump looks like, and
// how to turn one into the form the renderer wants. Split out of Memory
// because it is a fact about FILES, not about the memory map, and because
// it is worth testing on its own: two dumps of the same size can need
// opposite treatment.
//
// POM2's internal form is AppleWin's "csbits" convention:
//   * one byte per glyph row, 7 visible pixels
//   * bit 0 = leftmost, 1 = lit
//   * codes $00-$3F (inverse range) are stored PRE-FLIPPED, so they already
//     read as inverse video; codes $40-$7F hold the non-flashing glyph and
//     the renderer XORs 0x7F on the flash phase.
//
// Three dump conventions map onto it:
//
//   4 KB (IIe-class)  Pixels are stored with inverted polarity (1 = OFF)
//                     and bit 0 already leftmost. XOR 0xFF, nothing else.
//
//   2 KB, marked      AppleWin's `Apple2_Video.rom`. Bit 7 of each byte
//                     marks the range: clear = inverse (XOR the low 7),
//                     set = flashing (leave). Bits are stored MSB-left
//                     (the video shift register reads that way), so the
//                     low 7 are reversed.
//
//   2 KB, unmarked    The Videx LOWER CASE CHIP. Same MSB-left bit order,
//                     but bit 7 is never set anywhere — so the range has
//                     to be split by OFFSET instead (first 512 bytes are
//                     the inverse range). Choosing wrong here inverts the
//                     entire normal range, and because the glyph SHAPES
//                     come out identical either way it is invisible in a
//                     screenshot of ordinary text.
