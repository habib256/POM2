// NetworkCoordinator — the host side of the FujiNet relay.
//
// SlotBus owns the card; this class resolves it under the machine lock,
// publishes an immutable snapshot for ImGui, and applies a frame's commands
// after re-resolving. Nothing SlotBus owns escapes a call.
//
// It also holds the host-only state that has no emulated counterpart: the
// serial-device scan, the helper program's configured and resolved paths, and
// the status line. Those belong together because they are all answers about
// the HOST, and none of them needs the machine lock.
