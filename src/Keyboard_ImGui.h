// Keyboard_ImGui — the Apple //e keyboard as a clickable picture.
//
// A photo of the real thing (`pic/Keyboard_AppleIIe.jpeg`) with one hotspot
// per cap, measured off the image itself rather than drawn as a grid of
// buttons. The point is that the legends are the REAL legends — a user
// hunting for the key that types `[` on a //e finds it where it is on the
// machine, including the ones a modern host keyboard has nowhere to put
// (Open-Apple, Solid-Apple, the //e's own Reset).
//
// Two jobs, and only two: hit-test the pointer against the layout, and hold
// the modifier latches. What a key MEANS to the emulated machine belongs to
// MainWindow — this class returns a `KeyHotspot*` and the latch state and
// stops there, so it needs no emulator headers and no lock.
//
// Latches, not chords: a mouse has one pointer, so Ctrl+Reset or
// Open-Apple+Ctrl+Reset cannot be clicked simultaneously. Shift / Control /
// Caps Lock / Open-Apple / Solid-Apple therefore TOGGLE and stay down until
// used or clicked again — the same contract as every on-screen keyboard and
// as the //e's own mechanically-latching Caps Lock.
