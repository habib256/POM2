// Sony35Gcr — the Apple 800K 3.5" GCR *read* path, as one pure module.
//
// Two things in POM2 have to turn Sony GCR cells back into 512-byte ProDOS
// blocks, and they arrive at the cells from opposite directions:
//
//   * `Sony35Drive` — the guest wrote them, a track at a time, through the
//     IWM; `decodeAndCommit` folds them back into the mounted image.
//   * `Disk35Image` — a WOZ flux dump on disk holds them already, and a
//     `.woz` has to become blocks at LOAD time (POM2 stores 3.5" media as a
//     flat block array; it has no GCR encoder, so there is nothing to mount
//     a flux image *as*).
//
// The decode is identical either way and is a port of MAME
// `flopimg.cpp:2107 extract_sectors_from_track_mac_gcr6` (address field
// D5 AA 96 + track/sector/side/format/checksum, data field D5 AA AD + 175
// 4-in-3 GCR groups + the three-way running checksum + DE AA). Keeping one
// copy is the point of this file: a second transcription of the tables and
// the checksum walk is a second thing to get subtly wrong.
