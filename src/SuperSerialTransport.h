// SuperSerialTransport — the host side of the Super Serial Card's bridge.
//
// The card owns the ACIA registers, the RX/TX rings, the telnet parser and
// the emulated line rate. A transport owns whatever carries bytes to and from
// a peer — a loopback TCP listener and its worker thread in the production
// case — and reaches the card only through the hooks on SuperSerialCard
// marked "Transport hooks".
//
// The split exists so the card can be driven with no socket and no thread:
// a fake transport calls the same hooks directly.
