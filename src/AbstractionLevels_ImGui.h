// AbstractionLevels_ImGui — "what does POM2 emulate as silicon, and what does
// it emulate as a service?", as a window instead of a document.
//
// The prose lives in `docs/lle_vs_hle.md` and stays the reference; this panel
// is that document's master table made *live*. Two things a Markdown file
// cannot do, and they are the whole reason the window exists:
//
//   1. **Say which level is running right now.** Nearly every ROM-driven low
//      level in POM2 degrades SILENTLY to a higher one when its dump is
//      absent — Disk II drops from the real P6 LSS PROM to the legacy
//      32-cycle nibble gate, the Mouse Card falls from an executing M68705
//      mask ROM to a C++ state machine, ClockCard and Grappler+ fall back to
//      synthetic ROMs. The machine still works, which is correct product
//      behaviour and exactly why nobody notices. `docs/lle_vs_hle.md`
//      ("Keeping a level once you have it") names this as a structural hole
//      and proposes reporting *degraded* rather than merely *missing*. This
//      panel is that report.
//   2. **Let the user move the boundary.** Four subsystems ship both levels
//      behind one interface — that is a deliberate policy ("when both levels
//      have real users, ship both"), but it was only reachable by knowing
//      which catalog key meant which. Here the choice is the level.
//
// Host-side only: the catalog is static data, the live state is a snapshot
// the caller fills, and every switch is returned as a request for the caller
// to execute. The panel takes no lock and touches no emulator state.
