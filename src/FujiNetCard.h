// FujiNetCard — a SmartPort controller whose devices live outside POM2.
//
// FujiNet (https://fujinet.online/) is an ESP32 peripheral for 8-bit machines
// whose headline feature is the `N:` NETWORK DEVICE: a deported TCP/IP stack
// the guest drives with simple commands, so an Apple II gets HTTP, TNFS, FTP,
// SSH, Telnet and a JSON parser without running a byte of TCP/IP itself. On
// the Apple II EVERY FujiNet function is a SmartPort unit — block storage, the
// network device, the clock, the printer, the modem, CP/M — so relaying the
// SmartPort protocol relays all of them at once. That is why this is one card
// and not six.
//
// This card is a RELAY, not an emulation. It presents a SmartPort controller
// to the guest and forwards every call, verbatim, to a real FujiNet over
// SP-over-SLIP (SpOverSlipLink) — either a FujiNet desktop build over loopback
// TCP, or a physical board over USB CDC-ACM.
//
// ── Sources ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// MAME HAS NO FUJINET DEVICE, so the project's usual "MAME = source of truth"
// rule cannot apply here. The references are:
//
//   * the protocol spec: FujiNet wiki "Apple II SP over SLIP", revision of
//     2025-01-25 — normative for framing and the request/response tables;
//   * the working reference implementation in the FujiNet fork of AppleWin
//     (`source/SmartPortOverSlip.cpp`, `source/devrelay/**`,
//     `firmware/SPoverSLIP/spoverslip.s`), GPL-2.0-or-later, so
//     GPLv3-compatible — consulted, not copied;
//   * Apple IIc Technical Reference ch. 6 (Block Device I/O) and Apple IIgs
//     Firmware Reference ch. 7 (SmartPort Firmware) for the call convention
//     the spec supplements.
//
// ── How the trap works ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The slot ROM is synthesised by POM2 (no dump needed, same H1 pattern as
// ProDOSHardDiskCard) and does almost nothing. Both entry points are three
// instructions:
//
//     LDA #$65        ; $66 for the ProDOS entry
//     STA $C0n2       ; ← the trap: control passes to the host here
//     CMP #$01        ; turns A != 0 into carry-set
//     RTS
//
// `deviceSelectWrite` sees that store and does everything on the host: it
// reads the SmartPort parameter list out of emulated RAM, REWRITES THE RETURN
// ADDRESS ON THE STACK so the ROM's RTS lands after the three inline bytes a
// SmartPort call carries, performs the SP-over-SLIP round trip, writes the
// response back into emulated RAM, and sets A/X/Y and the flags. The guest
// cannot tell the difference from a fast SmartPort controller.
//
// Memory and CPU access go through Memory::memRead/memWrite and the M6502
// accessors, injected by the host at plug time — the same pattern SoftCardZ80
// uses, and for the same reason: only the real dispatcher knows whether a
// ProDOS buffer currently resolves to main or aux RAM.
//
// ── What this card does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   * //c-class machines. Their forced INTCXROM masks all slot ROM, so the
//     card is meaningful on II+ / //e only. On a real //c the FujiNet *is*
//     the SmartPort on the disk port, which would mean hanging the relay off
//     the on-board $C500 hole instead — a separate piece of work.
//   * Rewind. The peer is a live external device; rewinding the guest past a
//     WriteBlock does not un-write the peer's SD card, and past an HTTP POST
//     does not un-post it. The ring keeps working; this card simply does not
//     roll back with it. See loadSnapshotState.
