// MemoryWatchSink — where Memory reports a watched access.
//
// An interface rather than a direct call into `pom2::Debugger` for one
// practical reason: `Memory.cpp` is linked into two dozen test binaries and a
// benchmark, and none of them should have to pull the debugger in behind it.
// Memory holds a pointer that is null in every one of those builds, and the
// only implementor is `Debugger` (see Memory.h § Write watchpoints).
