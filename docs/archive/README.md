# Archive — historical working documents

One-off snapshots of finished efforts, kept for **provenance** (the *why* behind
a fix, the audit method). They are **not** maintained: their line references may
be stale and their conclusions are already folded into the living docs. Do not
treat them as current state. These files are kept in their original French.

| File | What | Status → where the current info lives |
|---|---|---|
| `video_parity_audit_2026-05-30.md` | Video/colour/effects parity audit (9 findings, TOP-10 actions) | Headline gaps **resolved** (square-filter, OE GPU/CPU). Living doc: [`../graphics_modes_comparison.md`](../graphics_modes_comparison.md). Residuals → `TODO.md` § [Display] *CRT parity refinements*. |
| `video_parity_revalidation_2026-05-30.md` | Post-WIP re-validation of the audit above + F0–F9 implementation cards | Same. The F2/F3/F4/F6/F7 cards still open are listed in `TODO.md` § [Display]. |
| `oe_gpu_cpu_parity.md` | Agent notes on the OE GPU≠CPU colour bug | **Resolved + pinned** `oe_demod_gpu_cpu_parity`. Living detail: `DEV.md` § Composite NTSC shader + that archived changelog, 2026-05-30. |
| `CHANGELOG-2026-05.md` | Pre-v0.7 changelog entries (2026-05-14 → 2026-05-30) | Split out of the living `CHANGELOG.md` to keep it light. Current changelog → [`../../CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md). |

Full canonical history → `git log` + [`../../CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md).
