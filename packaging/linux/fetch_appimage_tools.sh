# appimagetool from AppImageKit release **12** — the SAME release as the
# runtime below, and that is the whole point.
#
# The obvious modern choice, appimagetool 1.9.1, cannot be used here: its
# bundled mksquashfs supports **zstd only**, while the ET_EXEC runtime this
# packaging needs (see below) reads only xz and zlib. The two cannot be made to
# agree — `--comp xz` fails with "Compressor xz is not supported", and the
# default zstd produces an image whose own runtime cannot open it ("Squashfs
# image uses (null) compression"). That mismatch shipped silently: the package
# has the right name, ELF type and magic, and dies on first extraction.
#
# Taking both halves from release 12 makes them compatible by construction, and
# both are immutable release assets rather than a moving `continuous` tag.
# build_appimage.sh proves the pairing after every build by asking the image to
# extract itself.

# linuxdeploy, pinned to the IMMUTABLE dated release, not `continuous`.
#
# It used to come from `continuous`, and on 2026-09-01 upstream re-uploaded that
# asset under the same tag. The digest stopped matching, `sha256sum -c` failed
# as designed — and it did so during the v0.9.0 release run, taking all three
# aarch64 jobs down 35 seconds in while x86_64, macOS, Windows and WASM had
# already gone green. That is the worst moment to learn a dependency moved, and
# it is structural: a moving tag can only ever break at fetch time, and this
# script is only ever fetched by a release.
#
# The header above already says why appimagetool and the runtime take release
# 12 — "both are immutable release assets rather than a moving `continuous`
# tag". linuxdeploy simply had not been held to it. It is now: upstream does
# publish dated releases, whose assets carry an `updated_at` equal to their
# publication time and have never been rewritten.
#
# Verified before pinning, rather than copied from whatever the URL served:
# downloaded independently and hashed, and the result compared against the
# digest GitHub computes server-side for the asset — both
# 620095110d693282b8ebeb244a95b5e911cf8f65f76c88b4b47d16ae6346fcff. A checksum
# mismatch is the one signal that distinguishes upstream churn from a
# substituted binary, so re-pinning to "whatever is there now" without that
# second source would throw away the only protection the pin provides.
#
# If a newer linuxdeploy is ever needed, take the next dated release, not
# `continuous`. For the record, `continuous` as of 2026-09-01 was
# 556ab80baa98e600aa80f0dcedfb70bca0e1ce7e9f147fb345be3fcc3e91b2b1 (19 048 968
# bytes) — verified the same way on the day this pin moved.
