#  build_in_bookworm_pi.sh — the CORE-SPECIFIC Raspberry Pi build (PGO + LTO),
#  meant to run INSIDE a debian:bookworm arm64 container with the repo bind-
#  mounted on /work:
#
#    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work -e POM2_MCPU=cortex-a72 \
#        debian:bookworm bash /work/packaging/raspberry/build_in_bookworm_pi.sh
#
#  HOW THIS DIFFERS from `packaging/linux/build_in_bookworm_arm64.sh` (the
#  release AppImage), and why a second script exists at all:
#
#   · `-mcpu=<the exact core>` instead of generic aarch64. The published
#     AppImage has to run from a Pi 3 to a Pi 5; a machine you are setting up
#     runs on ITS Pi only. POM2's hot loop is the 6502 interpreter plus the
#     Disk II LSS — branch-dense code that cares about the right cost model.
#   · TWO PASSES guided by profile (PGO), then LTO. Measured on x86-64 at
#     identical sources: −39 % on a CPU-bound load, −29 % on a disk-active one,
#     with byte-identical output. It is the biggest lever available without
#     touching a line of emulation, and it is FREE here — the training run
#     happens on the CI runner, so the Pi pays nothing for it.
#     → docs/PERFORMANCE.md § 5.
#   · it emits TWO packages from ONE build, no recompilation:
#       - a `.tar.gz` laid out like `cmake --install` (bin/POM2 +
#         share/POM2/{roms,fonts,pic}) for a Pi OS **Lite** cabinet, which has
#         no FUSE and would have to extract an AppImage on every boot;
#       - an `.AppImage` for Pi OS **with a desktop**, where one clickable file
#         is what you want.
#
#  Why bookworm: Raspberry Pi OS IS Debian bookworm (glibc 2.36). Building on
#  the runner's own ubuntu-24.04-arm userland stamps GLIBC_2.39 and the binary
#  starts on no Pi at all. The floor is checked below and the build fails if it
#  is exceeded.
#
#  Honoured env: POM2_MCPU (default cortex-a72), POM2_VERSION, POM2_PGO=0 to
#  fall back to a single pass (script debugging / a quick build).
#
#  (c) 2026 VERHILLE Arnaud — POM2.
